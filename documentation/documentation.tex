\section{Overview}

This documentation was done by the author for her own self-study in the area of Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning). This repo contains hands-on for model development and model deployment. All documentation was done using \LaTeX

\section{Environment Setup}
This section explains how the environment and dependencies of each model was created and installed.


\subsection{Creating Environment}
\subsection{Installing Dependencies}

\section{Model Development}
Hands-on creating Deep Learning model. All model was developed by using Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. The dataset used in each of the model based on open-source dataset from kaggle. Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Time Series Forecasting problem was implemented in her self-learning module.
