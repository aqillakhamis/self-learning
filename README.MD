# SELF-LEARNING MODULE FOR DEEP LEARNING
This repo is created by the author for her self-learning in Deep Learning applications from model development and model deployment

## Dataset
The dataset used in the model development was extracted from Kaggle open-source dataset

## Model Development 
Deep Learning model development applied in this repo is for three applications: 
<ol>
<li>Computer Vision</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
<li>Time Series Forecasting</li>
</ol>

## Model Deployment 
Since the author have limited knowledege on model deployment. So, for a temporary to get basic knowledege, only 2 types of model deployment API will be applied
